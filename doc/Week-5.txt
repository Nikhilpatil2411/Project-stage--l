Week 5: Backend Enhancement & Matching Logic
Objectives:

Implement the expert-candidate matching algorithm using NLP.

Enhance Flask API to handle matching requests.

Begin testing and debugging of API responses.

Tasks Completed:

Integrated NLP-based skill extraction from candidate resumes.

Developed a matching algorithm to compare candidate skills with expert domains.

Enhanced Flask routes to return sorted expert matches.

Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.

Challenges Faced:

Handling inconsistencies in resume formatting during parsing.

Tuning the matching algorithm for higher relevance accuracy.

Next Steps:

Optimize matching logic for better speed and accuracy.

Start frontend integration of real-time matching results.

Prepare for deployment and testing on cloud.
